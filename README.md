# IDology External Identities self-service sign-up API connector integration

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) External Identities enable you to provide [self-service sign-up](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-overview) for external users so that collaboration is seamless and end-user friendly. [API connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/api-connectors-overview)â€¯enable you to leverage web APIs to integrate those self-service sign-up flows with external cloud systems.

Verifying a user's identity can be critical to securing an application from fraudulent and malicious actors and confidently allowing self-service sign-up. To accomplish this, you can use IDology's identity verification and proofing service including ID verification, Fraud prevention, Compliance, and other solutions.

## Prerequisites

Outline the required components and tools that a user might need to have on their machine in order to run the sample. This can be anything from frameworks, SDKs, OS versions or IDE releases.

## Solution Components

The IDology integration is comprised of the following components:
- Azure AD External Identities self-service sign-up user flow - The way to allow external customers to sign-up as external users to your organization.
- IDology -- The IDology service takes inputs provided by the user and
    verifies the user's identity.
- Custom web API -- This provided API implements the integration
    between the Azure AD self-service sign-up user flow and the IDology service to perform identity proofing at sign-up.

## Create an IDology account

When you are ready to get an IDology account, sign up using [this]https://www.idology.com/request-a-demo/microsoft-integration-signup/) web form.

## Deploy the API

Deploy the provided API code to an Azure service. The code can be
published from Visual Studio, following these
[instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure?view=vs-2019).

Note the URL of the deployed service. This will be needed to configure
Azure AD with the required settings.

# Configure an self-service sign-up user flow

[Create a self-service sign-up user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/self-service-sign-up-user-flow) for registering external users to your tenant. 

### Configure the API

Application settings can be [configured in the App service in
Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-app-settings).
This allows for settings to be securely configured without checking them
into a repository. The API needs the following settings configured:

| Application Setting Name    | Source                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| IdologySettings:ApiUsername | IDology service username.              |
| IdologySettings:ApiPassword | IDology service password.              |
| WebApiSettings:ApiUsername  | Set a username for accessing the API. |
| WebApiSettings:ApiPassword  | Set a password for accessing the API. |


### Create an API Connector

After the Azure AD tenant has been configured for use with External
Identities, setup an API connector with the following settings:
(relevant link for setting up API connector)

- **Endpoint URL**: Use the URL created when publishing the API service.
- **Username**: Username defined in the API configuration above (WebApiSettings:ApiUsername)
- **Password**: Password defined in the API configuration above (WebApiSettings:ApiPassword)
- **Claims to Send**
    - Given Name
    - Surname
    - Street Address
    - Postal Code

### Enable an API connectors in the user flow

Configure a user flow that utilizes the API connector created above in
the "Before Creating the user" step. (Documentation link for creating a
user flow)

## End user experience

Your self-service sign-up user flow should now be calling out the API, which uses the IDology service to verify an account and show a block page if a user's identity cannot be validated.
